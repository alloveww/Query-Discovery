# **Query-Discovery**
Medium to Advanced SQL Queries with PostgreSQL

## Project Description
This project contains a series of SQL queries designed to demonstrate medium to advanced SQL skills and techniques using PostgreSQL. The queries cover various use cases, including identifying top records for each group, filtering users based on specific criteria, detecting consistency in user ratings, and more. Each query solves a specific problem, providing insights and meeting business requirements for the data stored in the relational databases.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
* **Database Schema**: Explanation of the database schema used in the queries.See PNG files.
* **Queries**: A collection of SQL queries solving different problems. See SQL files.

## Database Schema

The database contains the following two schemas:<be>

**Movie:**
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Movie Schema.png" alt="Alt" width='500'/>
</div>

**Northwind:**
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Northwind Schema.png" alt="Alt" width='500'/>
</div>

## Key Features
The queries in this project showcase the use of advanced SQL techniques, including:
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window Functions
* Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
* Aggregate Functions (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
* Subqueries
* Filtering and Sorting

## Additional Notes
The queries assume that database schema and data are correctly set up and populated.
